How to do
*********

    - Git 1.7.2+ introduced the ability to cherry-pick a range of commits 
    
    - Cherry pick range (OLDER_COMMIT, NEWER_COMMIT] -> without commit_ref1:
        $ git cherry-pick OLDER_COMMIT..NEWER_COMMIT

    - Cherry pick range [OLDER_COMMIT, NEWER_COMMIT], including commit_ref1:
        $ git cherry-pick OLDER_COMMIT^..NEWER_COMMIT
