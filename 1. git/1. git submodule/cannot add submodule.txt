Issue:
    - I had a git submodule before I deleted it. Then I add submodule again by another url. Example:
            $ git submodule add 'https://tfs.vingroup.net/vsmart/E-COCKPIT/_git/vfrpc' pkg/vfrpc
    
    => Cannot add submodule and following text shows up:
            A git directory for 'pkg/vfrpc' is found locally with remote(s):

Solution:

    - remove the folder of the submodule.
    - remove from .gitmodules
    - rm -rf .git/modules/myproject
    - retry the above steps to add it again.
