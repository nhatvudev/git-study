--depth=<depth>

    Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote 
    branch history. If fetching to a shallow repository created by git clone with 
    --depth=<depth> option (see git-clone[1]), deepen or shorten the history to the 
    specified number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not fetched.
