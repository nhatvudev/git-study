Problems
********
    
    Assume that you commit some changes from local. Then, you pull the source code,
    but someone has pushed some changes to the remote respository before. You will
    have conflicts.


Solution
********

    In this document, I set up meld as my merge tool

    - Install "meld" application.

    - Set up merge tool:
        $ git config --global merge.tool "meld"

    - Overview merged files by:
        $ git log --merge

    - Merge and open merge tool:
        $ git merge
        $ git mergetool

    => Meld will display comparison of conflict files pair by pair.

    - Resolve the conflicts by Meld. Then commit and push.
