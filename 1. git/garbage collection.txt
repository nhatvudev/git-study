Question
********
    I just started playing with Git and was wondering about one specific case:

        I made a heavy commit, by mistake, and even worse I pushed it to the remote 
        server.

        Now I'm trying to get things back to the way they were, using 
        'git reset --hard v1.0' and 'git push -f origin master'.

    After doing that things seem OK, but when I look at the repo file size, it's 
    still as big as my wrong commit. Even if I try git gc to garbage collect, I have 
    no success. What should I do in that case, if I want to make a destructive change, 
    on purpose?

    If you type:
        git reflog

    you will see that your "big commit" is still there. By default, all entries are 
    kept for 30 days if unreachable, 90 days if reachable (via history).

    You can try and use 'git reflog --expire-unreachable=1.minute' for instance.

    git reflog expire --expire=now HEAD <branches which contained said commit>
    git gc
