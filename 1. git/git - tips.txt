1. Problem 1
************
    - Problem: For following part of a commit message:
            "UDP IPv6 packets auto flowlabels are using a 32bit secret"
        a) Look for all commits which contains above part in commit message.
        b) Look for all branches which contains the commits.

    - Solution:
        a) Use following command
            git log --all --grep="UDP IPv6 packets auto flowlabels are using a 32bit secret" | grep -B1 "Author: "

        b) After getting the commit ids. Use 2 following commands

$ commits=(aeaf285e8e5904ecaca43c1f1df966fea553b8af \

$ for commit in ${commits[@]}; do git branch -r --contains $commit; done



2. Problem 2
************
    - Problem: with the result from problem 1, look for every commit which is contained by any branch which contains "android-4.4-p" in its name.

    - Solution: use following command

$ for commit in ${commits[@]}; do 
branches=$(git branch -r --contains $commit)
if [[ $branches == *"android-4.4-p"* ]]; then
echo $commit
fi
done


3. Problem 3
************
    - Problem: Need to find in which commit a part of code is inserted (Ex: //Run in two different lists to prevent overlap display)
    - Solution: Get in the project (with valid git), input following command:
        $ git blame /home/nhatvtm/Desktop/nhap.txt

    Read the "nhap.txt" file, we will see following line:
c065f55f (MinhBQ2               2020-04-29 16:37:57 +0700 592)         //Run in two different lists to prevent overlap display
