git checkout
    - makes HEAD point to a commit in commit history. Without commit_ref, it shall keep HEAD.
    - makes files in working directory match staged index. If any file doesn't exist in
        staged index -> no change.

git reset
    - makes HEAD point to a commit in commit history and remove all commit after that commit in
            commit history.
    - There are 3 modes:
        --soft: keeps working directory and index tree.
        --mixed (default): keeps working directory, makes index tree match commit history.
        --hard: makes working directory and index tree match commit history.

git revert
    - creates a reverting commit.
