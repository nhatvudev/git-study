--branch <name>

    Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by the cloned 
    repositoryâ€™s HEAD, point to <name> branch instead. In a non-bare repository, this 
    is the branch that will be checked out. --branch can also take tags and detaches 
    the HEAD at that commit in the resulting repository.
